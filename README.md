## About the Video Course
The Apache Hadoop ecosystem is a popular and powerful tool to solve big data problems. With so many competing tools to process data, many users want to know which particular problems are well suited to Hadoop, and how to implement those solutions.

To know what types of problems are Hadoop-able it is good to start with a basic understanding of the core components of Hadoop. You will learn about the ecosystem designed to run on top of Hadoop as well as software that is deployed alongside it. These tools give us the building blocks to build data processing applications. This course covers the core parts of the Hadoop ecosystem, helping to give a broad understanding and get you up-and-running fast. Next, it describes a number of common problems as case-study projects Hadoop is able to solve. These sections are broken down into sections by different projects, each serving as a specific use case for solving big data problems.

By the end of this course, you will have been exposed to a wide variety of Hadoop software and examples of how it is used to solve common big data problems.
